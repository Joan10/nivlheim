### Nivlheim Code of Conduct

_This code of conduct is an adaptation of the [Debian code of conduct](https://www.debian.org/code_of_conduct)._

This code of conduct applies to the collaborative spaces for this project on Github and other modes of communication within the project. We intend these guidelines to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

#### 1. Be respectful.

In any project, inevitably there will be people with whom you may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that, but even so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour or personal attacks.

#### 2. Assume good faith

Contributors have many ways of reaching our common goals, which may differ from your ways. Assume that other people are working towards this goal.

#### 3. Be collaborative

This is a complex project; there is always more to learn. It's good to ask for help when you need it. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged. Similarly, offers for help should be seen in the context of our shared goal of improving the project.

#### 4. Try to be concise

Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by many people. Keep it short so people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary.

Try to bring new arguments to a conversation so that each comment/email adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.

Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.

#### 5. Be open

Preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless posting something sensitive. 

This applies to messages for help or support, too; a public support request is much more likely to result in an answer to your question, and if it is seen by more people they may provide additional information.

#### 6. Be welcoming

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you, we welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.

While much of the work for our project is technical in nature, we value and encourage contributions from those with expertise in other areas.
